## Objectives:
For our project, we aim to use machine learning algorithms and techniques to accurately classify songs into musical genres such as pop, disco, album rock, etc.

## Some Information on our Dataset
ID - an arbitrary unique track identifier title - track title\
artist - singer or band\
year - year of release (or re-release) bpm - beats per minute (tempo)\
nrgy - energy: the higher the value the more energetic\
dnce - danceability: the higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song\
dB - loudness (dB): the higher the value, the louder the song\
live - liveness: the higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording\ 
val - valence: the higher the value, the more positive mood for the song\
dur - duration: the length of the song\
acous - acousticness: the higher the value the more acoustic the song is\
spch - speechiness: the higher the value the more spoken word the song contains pop - popularity: the higher the value the more popular the song is\
top genre - genre of the track (and the target variable for this problem)

## Files Included:
Source Code in genrePrediction_Final.ipynb - download a copy then run (preferably in Jupyter environment)\
app.py - front end model\
    In order to run our front end model:\
    In Terminal, run code:\
    git clone https://github.com/aFishboy/ECS171GroupProject.git \
    then change directory:\
    cd ECS171GroupProject\
    In this directory, run the code:\
    python app.py\
    Then, copy the first link\
        should start with http://\
    and paste that link into your web browser\
    There are three lines of sample data to run on the site itself\
        Feel free to copy them one at a time and run our model!\
    Should you want to run the model on more data, navigate (on our repository) to CSVModelInput.csv\
        and CopyPaste any row and plug into the model!\
