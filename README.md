## Objectives:
For our project, we aim to use machine learning algorithms and techniques to accurately classify songs into musical genres such as pop, disco, album rock, etc.

## Some Information on our Dataset
ID - an arbitrary unique track identifier title - track title\
artist - singer or band\
year - year of release (or re-release) bpm - beats per minute (tempo)\
nrgy - energy: the higher the value the more energetic\
dnce - danceability: the higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song\
dB - loudness (dB): the higher the value, the louder the song\
live - liveness: the higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording\ 
val - valence: the higher the value, the more positive mood for the song\
dur - duration: the length of the song\
acous - acousticness: the higher the value the more acoustic the song is\
spch - speechiness: the higher the value the more spoken word the song contains pop - popularity: the higher the value the more popular the song is\
top genre - genre of the track (and the target variable for this problem)\
